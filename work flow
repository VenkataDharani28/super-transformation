The purpose of this function is to load a trained (fitted) workflow/model object from disk into your R environment so it can be used for making predictions or further analysis.

What it does:
Checks that the provided file path (workflow_fp) exists and is a character string.
Reads the workflow object from the file using readRDS().
Extracts the fitted workflow (fitted_wf) from the loaded object.
Verifies that the extracted object is a trained workflow using workflows::is_trained_workflow.
Returns the trained workflow object for use elsewhere in your code.
Why use it?
This function is typically used in a prediction or scoring pipeline to reload a previously trained model so you can apply it to new data.
